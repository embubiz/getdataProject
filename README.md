Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

In this repo you can find the main script, build in order to fullfill the project task,
plus other scripts, in which I defined some functions, where I thought it was necessary
and/or convenient, and subroutines.

Doing so, I could split the project into different tasks, one for each step of the
project itself (run_analysis.step*.R), and therefore make the different sections more
readable and easy to understand.

The generous use of comments then, also helps in the comprehension of the work.

Enjoy!
