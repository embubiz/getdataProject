Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

In this repo you can find the main script, build in order to fullfill the project task,
plus other scripts, in which I defined some functions, where I thought it was necessary
and/or convenient, and subroutines.

Doing so, I could split the project into different tasks, one for each step of the
project itself (run_analysis.step*.R), and therefore make the different sections more
readable and easy to understand.

The generous use of comments then, also helps in the comprehension of the work.

===============
HOW TO USE THE CONTENT OF THIS REPO

1. Copy run_analysis.R and the functions and subscripts directories in your working directory
   NOTE: your working directory can also be empty. There is no need to download the data first.
2. Change the variable wd in the run_analysis.R script, assigning it the path of your working directory
3. Run the script run_analysis.R
4. In your working directory you should have a new file called dataset.txt and the only
   variable in your R environment should be a tidy data frame called dataset, having 180 rows
   and 68 columns
